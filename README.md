## Overview of Election Audit

The Colorado Board of Elections has reached out for help conducting an election audit. They have provided us with a .csv file containing several pieces of information: a Ballot ID, County in which the vote was cast, and the Candidate selected on the ballot. Using Python, and the provided .csv file, they have asked us to analyze the data and provide the following information:

 - Total votes cast.
 - A complete list of counties with votes cast, including the number of votes cast in each county and the percent of the total vote cast in the county.
 - A complete list of candidates receiving votes in the election, including the number of votes they received and the percent of the total vote.
- The identity of the winner.
